# Story Quality Validation Report

Story: 4-2-performance-monitoring-and-metrics - Performance Monitoring & Metrics
Outcome: PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 1, Minor: 1)

## Critical Issues (Blockers)

None.

## Major Issues (Should Fix)

1. Ensure alerting behavior is validated by tests
   - Evidence: Testing subtasks added; verify implementation test covers alert hook path.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

1. Consider adding anchors in references to point to exact sections.

## Successes

- Status corrected to "drafted"; structure meets standard.
- Added Dev Notes with architecture constraints and explicit References subsection.
- Added explicit alerting tasks (AC: 6) and testing subtasks for all ACs.
- AC-to-task mapping now clearly covers 1–7.

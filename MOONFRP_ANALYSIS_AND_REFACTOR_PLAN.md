   - Performance metrics
   - Connection pooling optimization

2. **User Experience**
   - Colored output and progress indicators
   - Clear error messages
   - Quick help system
   - Status dashboard

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create New Streamlined Script
- **File**: `moonfrp-v2.sh`
- **Size Target**: < 2000 lines (vs current 9000+)
- **Focus**: Core functionality only

### Step 2: Environment Variable System
```bash
# Core Configuration
export MOONFRP_SERVER_IP="1.1.1.1"
export MOONFRP_SERVER_PORT="7000"
export MOONFRP_TOKEN="your-secure-token"
export MOONFRP_DASHBOARD_PORT="7500"
export MOONFRP_DASHBOARD_USER="admin"
export MOONFRP_DASHBOARD_PASS="admin123"

# Multi-IP Configuration
export MOONFRP_SERVER_IPS="1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2,3.3.3.3"
export MOONFRP_SERVER_PORTS="7000,7001,7002"

# Client Configuration
export MOONFRP_CLIENT_USER="moonfrp"
export MOONFRP_PROXY_PORTS="8080,8081,8082"
```

### Step 3: Simplified Menu Structure

```

### Step 4: Core Functions
1. **Quick Setup**: Automated server and client configuration
2. **Server Management**: FRP server configuration and management
3. **Client Management**: Multi-IP client configuration
4. **Service Control**: Start/stop/restart/status services
5. **Logs**: Real-time log viewing with filtering
6. **Configuration**: Environment variable management

## Testing Plan

   - Test each core function individually
   - Validate input/output handling
   - Test error conditions

2. **Configuration Testing**
   - Test environment variable parsing
   - Validate configuration generation
   - Test template substitution

### Phase 2: Integration Testing
1. **Fresh Server Testing**
   - Test on clean Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
   - Test installation process
   - Test configuration generation
   - Test service management

2. **Multi-IP Testing**
